G1 Extract
===================
An extractor for the g1.dat file from rct2.

Currently image type 1 and 5 are supported. Palettes (type 8) are not supported yet.

The images are saved as palettized png files. Some images may look a bit weird, but that's because they use primary, secondary and tertiary colors.
<h3>Usage</h3>
G1Extract.exe [g1path] [outdir]
